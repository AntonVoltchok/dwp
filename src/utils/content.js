    aboutMe: {
        firstPart: "I work from an attachment based framework to help identify causes of distress and increase awareness into disruptive patterns or problematic behaviors. Every person deserves to live a life that feels most fulfilling to them. We strive for happiness but sometimes old ways of thinking or behavioral patterns get in the way. We may feel stuck or find ourselves living a life based on the expectations of others or ways that do not feel authentic to our inner being.",
        secondPart: "My speciality involves working with trauma, which is not always limited to a single catastrophic event that happened to us. It can also be a number of smaller, less pronounced events, experienced in early childhood or throughout the lifespan. Trauma is what happens inside of us rather than to us and it is what we continue to carry along the way. The weight may become lighter with gained awareness and the willingness to acknowledge it. Any level of trauma has the possibility of impacting the way we perceive the world or maintain relationships in adulthood. With therapy, this can be worked through by means of identifying a specific impactful event or series of events and acknowledging and working through the feelings associated with the trauma.",
        thirdPart: "In working with children and teens, I focus on strength-based therapy to help identify causes of distress and increase problem-solving abilities and healthy coping strategies. This can improve communication skills and help regulate difficult or overwhelming emotions. I incorporate art therapy and play therapy as both are non-verbal techniques to process difficult feelings and experiences. I also specialize in working with families as every family goes through challenges as a unit and as children reach different developmental stages. Both personally and clinically, I enjoy art, music and mindfulness and incorporate them into my work as an entryway to process difficult emotions and to help self-soothe the body and mind."

    backgroundAndExperience: {
        firstPart: "I obtained my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology from Yeshiva University Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where I trained in various settings, including an acute psychiatric inpatient unit and psychiatric emergency room at Kings County Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY. My training also consisted of working with teens and young adults experiencing prodromal and acute symptoms of psychosis. In addition, I completed my Doctoral internship at a state psychiatric facility (Bronx Psychiatric Center) providing psychotherapy to individuals with severe and persistent mental illness. I performed research in the field of schizophrenia, including early psychosis and intervention (research publication).",
        secondPart: "Prior to my doctoral training, I received my Master’s degree in Psychology at The New School for Social Research where I performed psychological research and received intensive training in addictions counseling. I’ve worked with individuals with substance use disorders, working as an intensive outpatient therapist performing DBT and group therapy focusing on relapse prevention and recovery.",
        thirdPart: "Previous work experience also involves working in the field of forensic psychology, performing diagnostic and violence risk assessments. I held a position as Clinical Director for a non-profit organization, alongside the Manhattan District Attorney’s office, assessing inmates with severe mental illness in the criminal justice system. I continue to perform forensic evaluations to enhance clients’ ability to receive the treatment they need as opposed to continued incarceration."
